# react-portfolio

## App Description

This app serves as a portfolio for myself using react to show off some of my work to future employers. It contains an about me section, resume section where you are able to open my resume in a new tab, a featured projects section to show off a few of my projects, and finally a contact me section which contains my contact information.

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

I built this new updated portfolio so I would have an extra thing to show future employers when I begin applying for internships as well as to gain extra practice with using react

## Problems I came across during development

The biggest issue I came across was actually a routing issue with the resume which caused me to redo this project twice before realizing what the issue was

## What I learned from this project

With this project I was able to increase my skills with react

## App usage

This app is pretty simple to use, you simply open the link at the bottom of this ReadMe and you scroll through my information. All of the buttons work so you can use the navbar to quickly jump to a specific spot and you can press any of the buttons to complete their advertized action.
